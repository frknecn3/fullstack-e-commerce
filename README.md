<h2>Demonstration of the Project:</h2>

<p>
  This is a full-stack e-commerce project created by me, featuring a robust e-commerce application utilizing the technologies of React for frontend and Express, MongoDB and Node.js for backend. The web application includes not only a beautiful interface with interactive elements for the users, but also an Admin dashboard resembling the real-life implementations of similar apps. As a cherry on the top, the project includes a mockup of a Stripe Payment Process in order to maximize the project's similarity to real web app.
